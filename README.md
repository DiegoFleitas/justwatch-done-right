## Development

Vite is used for development and building the front-end application. It provides fast development with features like hot module replacement (HMR) and efficient production builds. Vite is configured using `vite.config.js` in the project root. All requests with the `/api` prefix are forwarded to the back-end Express server during development, using the vite server-proxy configuration

PRE: You need to have docker to run the image at /redis folder

- Rename .env.example to .env & update the values
- Run `npm run dev`

- Replace "name" & "app" strings with your new app name at package.json at fly.toml (respectively)
- Run `npm i`
- Rename .env.example to .env
